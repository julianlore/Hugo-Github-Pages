## Welcome to my website!

Welcome to my personal website. After having my old website up for a bit over two years and not updating it for a long time, I have decided to switch from a static website with raw HTML to a generated static website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Haven't decided completely as to what to put on here yet, aside from my personal portfolio, showcasing some projects and perhaps some resources. I may occasionally write some posts as well.
