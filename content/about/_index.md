Hello, my name is Julian Lore. I am currently doing my undergraduate studies, majoring in Statistics & Computer Science (B. Sc, joint major) at McGill University. I enjoy playing video games, reading, watching movies/shows and other things. I have a large interest in technology, in particular smartphones, GNU/Linux, software and configuration.
